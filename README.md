# tayyy's Config
The TF2 configuration that I use, based very heavily on the mastercom config, found here: https://github.com/mastercoms/mastercomfig.

The only launch option I use is -novid

My sensitivity in-game is set at 3.19, with my mouse set at 800 DPI, resulting in approximately 6 inches per 360. I use the same sensitivity on all classes.

Please refer to mastercoms' repository for installation instructions. More detailed information will be added here eventually.
